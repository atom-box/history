# Search bar for a web page
As you type in terms, the page searches, without waiting for a button click. If you click the button, whatever you typed is dynamically appended to the Constitution (bypassing the entire 2/3 fo the States thing).  No, it is not persistant to a database.
## Milwaukee Code Camp
This project was my demo for Milwaukee Code Camp. 
## If you just want to make the final product work:
[Run it](http://littlefurnace.com/elm/index.html)
## If you want to compile it:
If you want to witness the full glory of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), and make this compile from Elm into compiled Javascript: <br/>
1) Make sure you have Node and NPM.<br>
2) install Elm on your machine:<br/>
`npm install -g elm`
(Longer installation documentation is here: https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)<br/>
3) clone this repository<br/>
Then you might need to do <br/>
		`elm init`<br/>
		`elm make page.elm `<br/>
4) You should get a file, page.html that you can double click to open in your browser.  That's it.
