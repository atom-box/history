This project was my demo for Milwaukee  code camp. To make it run: <br/>
1) install elm on your machine:<br/>
`npm install -g elm`
(Longer installation documentation is here: https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)<br/>
2) clone this repository<br/>
3a) Skip to 3b, or if you want to compile the elm source code <br/>
you might need to do <br/>
		`elm init`<br/>
		`elm make page.elm --output monday.js`<br/>
3b) when you double click assets/flood.html it should open up the compiled code called monday.js in your browser.  That's it.
<br><br>Note to self: the local folder for this is C:code\my-talks\project_2-2
