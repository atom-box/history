* As you type in terms, the page searches. 
* If you click the button, whatever you typed is dynamically appended to the Constitution (bypassing that pesky 2/3 of the States approval thing). 
* No, it is not persistant to a database.
## Milwaukee Code Camp
This project was my demo for Milwaukee Code Camp. 
## Short
This is not a very long program but the Functional Programming was new to me.  So was the MODEL - UPDATE - VIEW paradigm.
## About Elm
Elm is a language for the front end that compiles to Javascript.  Elm creates a smaller asset than other methods because it is compiled.  Elm is 100% functional so it can run for years without throwing an exception.<br><br>
A few resources:
* The official [Elm page](https://elm-lang.org/).
* A free [textbook](https://elmprogramming.com/).
* Keyhole Software's [blog entry](https://keyholesoftware.com/2019/07/24/elm-language/ ) on Elm.

## If you want to compile this file:
If you want to witness the full glory of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), and make this compile from Elm into compiled Javascript: <br/>
1) Make sure you have Node and NPM.<br>
2) install Elm on your machine:<br/>
`npm install -g elm`
(Longer installation documentation is here: https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)<br/>
3) clone this repository<br/>
Then you might need to do <br/>
		`elm init`<br/>
		`elm make page.elm `<br/>
4) You should get a file, page.html that you can double click to open in your browser.  That's it.
